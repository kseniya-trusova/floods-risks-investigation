# Description
This repository is the contribution to the Reducing Flood Risks in Belgrade Area through AI Solutions challenge organized by Omdena Serbia Chapter.

General project link: https://github.com/OmdenaAI/belgrade-serbia-reducing-floods

The repository contains the EDA notebook.
# Challenge details
The task was to provide an AI predictive system, which can give a possibility for floods, based on the current levels of the water, precipitation, and other parameters. For the training, planned to use the historical hydrometeorology data of the Belgrade area, focusing on time fragments of recent floods in the last 100 years.

Project goals were the following:
1. Collect Datasets with historical hydrological data.
2. Data Processing
3. Machine learning process
4. API for a predictive service for floods

As a result, the data 2000-2022 was collected by the team.
